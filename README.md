# Project Description.

This project focuses on cleaning and analysing a messy dataset on shark attacks using Data Wrangling techniques in Python. The ultimate goal is to prepare the dataset for exploratory analysis and to answer specific hypotheses about patterns and trends in shark attacks. Cleaning includes removing null values, duplicates, string manipulation, and more.


# Hypotheses.
During the project, we formulated the following hypotheses to guide our analysis process:
- Shark attacks occur more frequently in certain geographic locations.
- Sharks attack more people who engage in aquatic activities such as surfing or diving.
- Shark attacks are more common in men than in women.


# Project structure.
The project was divided into the following phases:
- Initial analysis of the dataset:
  - Load the dataset into Python and review its structure.
  - Identify problems such as null values, duplicate data, and the need for column formatting.   
    columns.
 
- Data cleaning: Apply at least five data cleaning techniques.
  - Elimination of null values and duplicates.
  - String formatting to ensure consistency.
  - Standardisation of columns to facilitate analysis.
  - Review and manipulation of columns containing dates.
 
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - We performed exploratory analysis to validate hypotheses using aggregation techniques and data visualisation in different graphs.

- Presentation of results:
  - Results were presented through a clear narrative highlighting the most relevant findings and visualisations illustrating identified trends.

# File structure:
- main.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with all the cleanup and analysis code.
- functions.py: Python file containing reusable functions for data cleansing.
- README.md: Project documentation.

# Technologies used.
- Programming language: Python
- Main libraries: 
  - pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
  - matplotlib and seaborn: For the creation of visualisations.

# Results.
- Hypothesis 1: Confirmed. Shark attacks are more frequent in coastal areas of the United States of America, Australia and South Africa.
- Hypothesis 2: Half confirmed. Surfers are more likely to be attacked by sharks. On the other hand, we have not been able to confirm the hypothesis that people who 
  that people who scuba dive are more likely to have a shark attack.
- Hypothesis 3: Confirmed. Men are more likely to be attacked by sharks. 
  
# Conclusions.
Analysis of the shark attack data identified important patterns that may be useful for businesses selling aquatic experiences, such as diving tours or surfing lessons.
